- **Replaced**: Mock scraped products with real `useScrapingResults` hook
- **Added**: Real scraping controls with target categories and stores
- **Added**: Live progress monitoring with polling
- **Added**: CSV export functionality
- **Added**: Real-time status updates

### 3. Competitive Analysis Page (`app/competitive-analysis/page.tsx`)

- **Replaced**: Mock store analysis with `/routes/competitive-analysis/stores`
- **Added**: Real calculated overview statistics
- **Added**: Dynamic filtering and data visualization
- **Added**: Error handling and empty state management

### 4. Pricing Recommendations Page (`app/pricing-recommendations/page.tsx`)
- **Replaced**: Mock recommendations with real `usePriceOptimization` hook
- **Added**: Real batch optimization with configurable constraints
- **Added**: Live filtering by category, risk level, and confidence
- **Added**: Real scenario analysis and detailed product views
- **Added**: Export functionality and constraint management

## API Integration Points

### Backend Endpoints Used:
- `GET /routes/health` - Health check
- `GET /routes/products` - Product catalog
- `GET /routes/dashboard-stats` - KPI statistics
- `GET /routes/competitive-analysis/categories` - Category analysis
- `GET /routes/competitive-analysis/stores` - Store analysis
- `POST /routes/start-scraping` - Start scraping run
- `GET /routes/scraping-progress/{run_id}` - Monitor progress
- `GET /routes/scraping-results/{run_id}` - Get scraped data
- `GET /routes/runs/{run_id}/export.csv` - Export CSV
- `POST /routes/optimize-price` - Single product optimization
- `POST /routes/optimize-batch` - Batch optimization

### Hooks Used:
- `useScrapingRun` - Manage scraping operations
- `useScrapingResults` - Handle scraped data
- `usePriceOptimization` - Price recommendations
- `useApiHealth` - Monitor backend health

## Key Features Now Working

### ✅ Real Data Flow
- All pages now display real data from the database
- Live updates and polling for active operations
- Proper error handling and loading states

### ✅ Interactive Functionality
- Start and monitor scraping runs
- Generate pricing recommendations
- Export data as CSV
- Filter and analyze competitive data

### ✅ Error Handling
- Network error handling
- API error messages
- Fallback states for missing data
- Loading indicators

### ✅ Performance
- Efficient data fetching with React hooks
- Proper state management
- Minimal re-renders with dependency arrays

## Testing Verified

### Backend Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/routes/health
# Response: {"ok":true,"db_ready":true,"status":"healthy"}
```

### Data Endpoints
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/routes/products
# Returns: 6 seeded products with proper structure

curl http://localhost:8000/routes/dashboard-stats  
# Returns: Real statistics calculated from database
```

### Optimization
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/routes/optimize-batch
# Returns: Real pricing recommendations with scenarios
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Frontend API base URL (defaults to http://localhost:8000)
- `DATABASE_URL` - Backend database connection

### Development Servers
- Frontend: `pnpm dev` (http://localhost:3000)
- Backend: `fastapi dev api/main.py` (http://localhost:8000)

## Next Steps

The frontend-backend integration is now complete and functional. Users can:

1. **View Dashboard** - See real KPIs and product portfolio
2. **Run Scraping** - Start competitor price collection
3. **Analyze Competition** - View market positioning data
4. **Get Recommendations** - Generate AI-powered price suggestions
5. **Export Data** - Download results in CSV format

All dummy data has been replaced with real API integration, and the application is ready for production use.
